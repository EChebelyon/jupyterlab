This repo illustrates some features of JupyterLab, these features make it my preferred notebook environment.

## Jupyter lab installation and awesome extensions
Create a conda environment if you use conda

`conda create --name <NAME OF YOUR ENV>`

you can choose to set channel priorities.

Activate the environment

`conda activate <NAME OF YOUR ENV>`

Install Jupyterlab

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

or 

`pip install jupyterlab`

conda has a conflict resolution mechanism and is therefore preferrable, although it might take a long time.

Spin up the server on your localhost:

`jupyter lab`

Once the server is running on the browser you can change the themes, fonts, display orientations etc.
